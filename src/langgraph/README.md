# LangGraph
* LangGraph is a library within the LangChain ecosystem designed to simplify the development of complex applications involving multiple large language models (LLMs). 
* It introduces a graph-based framework for orchestrating workflows, enabling developers to create stateful, multi-agent systems efficiently.
* Key features of LangGraph include:
  - **Graph Structures**: Applications are represented as directed graphs, where nodes perform specific tasks (like text generation or data manipulation) and edges define the flow of information.
  - **State Management**: LangGraph automatically tracks and updates the state across interactions, ensuring context is maintained.
  - **Coordination**: It ensures agents execute tasks in the correct order and exchange information seamlessly.
* LangGraph is particularly useful for building sophisticated conversational flows, integrating tools, and managing dynamic execution paths.
